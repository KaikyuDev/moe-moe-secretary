### Installing
In order to install Moe Moe Secretary, please download the latest jar from the [Github Releases](TODO)\
You'll need a JRE (1.8+) installed, you can get it [here](https://adoptopenjdk.net/installation.html#x64_win-jre).\
Place the JAR file in a secure place, better if it's in a folder
 
### Usage

once started you'll find a waifu floating on your desktop (Ptilopsis from Arknights)
- You can move her around by dragging her
- You can click her to trigger "on click" dialogs
- You can close her by clicking the mouse wheel on her\
(if you don't have a mouse wheel, ALT F4 combination will do the job)

### Configuration
In the JAR file's folder, after starting MMS at least once, there will be a folder named "config",\
inside it you'll find a file named **config.properties**.

**config.properties** file contains **all** the settings for your secretary.

**TIP**: Saving this file will apply the changes to the secretary on the fly.

Check [this](TODO) table to see all the possible Adapters and adapter-configurations.\
All the other settings are self-explanatory.

### Adapters
Adapters are used to access different waifus on the internet.\
Moe Moe Secretary uses public wikis data to download images and dialogs, where available.\
If you think that a wiki does not like this behaviour, please open an issue.
